BREAKDOWN OF WORK:

# DevHouse - Sprint Progress Log

## ðŸ“… March 16th (3rd sprint complete)

### Adnan Chahin
I worked on the following tasks:

1. `<User Profile Editing Functionality >` â€“ This task allows logged-in users to update their email, username, or password from the profile page. 

2. `<Error Debugging & Login Troubleshooting>` â€“ Debugged multiple backend and SSR-related issues (PrismaClient is not defined, Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'parse')).

3. One issue im running into is the logging in session. For some reason when logging in with correct credentials, login page just refreshes and replaces my email with a username but doesnt actually login the session. Need to do more research on this and try to fix it.
