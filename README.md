BREAKDOWN OF WORK:

# DevHouse - Sprint Progress Log

## ðŸ“… March 16th (3rd sprint complete)

### Adnan Chahin
I worked on the following tasks:

1. `<User Profile Editing Functionality >` â€“ This task allows logged-in users to update their email, username, or password from the profile page. 

2. `<Error Debugging & Login Troubleshooting>` â€“ Debugged multiple backend and SSR-related issues (PrismaClient is not defined, Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'parse')).

3. `<Fixed logging in session error>` - Added email + username fields for login, made it work because app was requiring username but field stated email. 

Issue im facing, I implemented editing, deleting and posting posts in the backend, but im having trouble connecting the frontend to the backend when requests are being sent!
