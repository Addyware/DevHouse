March 9th (First Sprint Complete)
Shabnam:
I worked on the following tasks:
1. Worked on Register Error - This task is responsible for user register functionality, so that anytime the user who is already logged in cannot register again, they would receive an error says that you already registered, that took me 15 hours
2. I also watched 2 of the videos you provided for SOLID
