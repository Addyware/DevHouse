March 17th (Second Sprint Complete)
Shabnam:
I worked on the following tasks:
1. <Failed login error message> - This task is responsible for user login, so that when user's output for login is incorrect, then receive an error message that your login is failed.
2. I also watched in-class videos as I was absent last class.
3. <Merge conflict> - I made sure that all branches are merged successfully.
